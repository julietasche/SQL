FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product='iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) = 6;

--To select the customer account numbers for all the orders placed in February:
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust 

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6;

--To see which product was the cheapest sold in January and for what price:
SELECT product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

--To see the total revenue for each product sold in January:
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--To see which products were sold in February at a specific location (548 Lincoln St., Seattle, WA 98101), how many of each product were sold, and the total revenue:
SELECT SUM(Quantity) as Total_Quantity,
product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--To see how many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February and what the average amount spent was for those customers:
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE FEB.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--To see all the products sold in February in Los Angeles and how many of each product were sold:
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

SELECT distinct location, COUNT(orderID) AS Quantity_Sold

AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3

--To see how many headphones were sold in February and how many of each type were sold:
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity

GROUP BY Product;

--To see the average amount spent per account in February:
SELECT SUM(Quantity*price) / COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--To see the average quantity of products purchased per account in February:
SELECT ROUND(SUM(quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)) AS Avg_Quantity_Purchased
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
