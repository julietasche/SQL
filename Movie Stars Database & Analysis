FOR THIS PROJECT, I FIRST CREATED A FEW DATA TABLES, THEN RAN SOME QUERIES TO ANALYZE THE DATA & RELATE SOME OF THE DATA FROM EACH TABLE

--> DATA TABLES I CREATED:

CREATE TABLE actors
(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT, 
  movie TEXT, 
  oscar_noms INTEGER);

INSERT INTO actors
VALUES (1, "Jennifer Aniston", "Wanderlust", 0);

INSERT INTO actors
VALUES (2, "Jennifer Lawrence", "Silver Linings Playbook", 4);


INSERT INTO actors
VALUES (3, "Meryl Streep", "It's Complicted", 21);

INSERT INTO actors
VALUES (4, "Brad Pitt", "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood", 7);

INSERT INTO actors
VALUES (5, "Leonardo DiCaprio", "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood", 7);

INSERT INTO actors
VALUES (6, "Bradley Cooper", "Silver Linings Playbook", 9);



CREATE TABLE personal (partner_id INTEGER, name TEXT, state_born TEXT, siblings INTEGER, children INTEGER);

INSERT INTO personal VALUES (0, "Jennifer Lawrence", "Kentucky", 2, 1);

INSERT INTO personal VALUES (4, "Jennifer Aniston", "California", 2, 0);

INSERT INTO personal VALUES (1, "Brad Pitt", "Oklahoma", 2, 4);

INSERT INTO personal VALUES (0, "Bradley Cooper", "Pennsylvania", 1, 0);


CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, title TEXT, release_date INTEGER, actorid_1 INTEGER, actorid_2 INTEGER);

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (1, "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood", 2020, 4, 5);

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (2, "It's Complicated", 2009, 3, 0);

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (3, "Wanderlust", 2012, 1, 0);

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (4, "Silver Linings Playbook", 2012, 2, 6);

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (5, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith", 2005, 4, 0);



-->DATA ANALYSIS:

--To see which actors are originally from California:
SELECT personal.name FROM personal WHERE state_born = "California";

--To see which actor has the most Oscar nominations:
SELECT actors.name, MAX(oscar_noms) FROM actors;

--To see which actor has the least Oscar nominations:
SELECT actors.name, MIN(oscar_noms) FROM actors;

--To see which actors have been in a relationship before:
SELECT actors.name, personal.name AS partner_name FROM actors JOIN personal ON actors.id=personal.partner_id; 

--To see which actors have been in which movies:
SELECT movies.title, actors.name FROM movies JOIN actors ON movies.actorid_1=actors.id;
