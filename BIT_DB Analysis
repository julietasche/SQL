-->Analysis from sample Customer and Sales data tables:

--To determine the number of orders placed in January:
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--To see how many of those orders in January were for an iPhone:
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product='iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) = 6;

--To select the customer account numbers for all the orders placed in February:
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust 

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6;

--To see which product was the cheapest sold in January and for what price:
SELECT product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

--To see the total revenue for each product sold in January:
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--To see which products were sold in February at a specific location (548 Lincoln St., Seattle, WA 98101), how many of each product were sold, and the total revenue:
SELECT SUM(Quantity) as Total_Quantity,
product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--To see how many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February and what the average amount spent was for those customers:
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE FEB.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
